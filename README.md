1.	What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?

Theater is the hottest category in Kickstarter campaigns, followed by music, technology, film & video; only theater, music, film & video have access 50% chance to success in overall categories. 

Classical music, documentary, electronic music, hardware, metal, nonfiction, pop, radio & podcasts, rock, shorts, tabletop games and television have 100% chance of successful crowdfunding in Kickstarter campaigns. 

2.	What are some of the limitations of this dataset?

There are a lot of crowdfunding firms on the market; this dataset only indicates the situation that Kickstarter faces, the study of the trend of the crowdfunding market should be extended. There are not enough independent variables in the dataset to support sophisticated data analysis. 

3.	What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?

We can create a table that shows which sub-category of the parent category that has the highest chance to success. We can create a time series plot of a specific category.
